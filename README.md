# ToolManagerGMA
Tool Manager GMA is a web application inted to be used as a pseudo-ERP for machining and industrial companies that have to manage the different tools/pieces and machines 
of the workshop.

It allows the user to trace tools as they are used, counting the hours it has been used, the machine it can be used for, the different specs and extra data. Manage the different
orders, from clients and suppliers, and the dates the orders and invoices are generated.


## Concepts
-Machine: Machines populate the workshop, they create the products for the company given some materials and tools.

-Tool: It is the piece the machine uses.
